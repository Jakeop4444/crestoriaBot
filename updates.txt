- Due to popular demand, you can now see a list of the upcomming events, check it out with the new `~events` command!

Bug Fixes:
- If your Player ID began with a 0, it would not display, this has been fixed as of this update.
- The SR Version of Aegis was neglected in the previous update, he has been included in this update.

Known Bugs:
- The `~search` command has been a bit finicky when it comes to searching the new Summer units, this is currently being worked on. As a temporary work around, search those units by their Titles for the time being.
- The current summer gacha has not been added to the gacha pool as of yet, we are currently finding a way to speed up the gacha process.
