Small tutorial in this update: Setting a profile unit!
_When setting a profile unit, it's the character name plus the first letter of each part of their title, for example to set "[Boy Swaithed in Sin] Kanata" to your profile, his input name would be kanata_bsis_

All of the new SSR/SR units have been added to the profile image commands! You can now have the following characters displayed on your profile!
_Lloyd, Kohaku, Rita, Estelle, Ludger, Jude_

__**There was a notice earlier that stated we would need to wipe the user input for the profiles. We are happy to say we have worked around the need for doing so! All the titles have also beed edited to match in game, so please take this into account when editing profiles!**__

Chronos can currently be set as a Dark and a Light unit. His element was changed from the OBT to the current release and we are waiting a bit to see if that is permanent or a bug

To match Crestoria's name limit, the Guild and Profile names now have a character limit of 12 characters. If you set either of these names past 12 characters, it will automatically be cut off on display and entry now.

**New Commands:**
`~vote (pvp|element) (unit) (score)` - Integrated into Misteltein#7777's unit database (https://www.tocdb.xyz/), you can vote for the community tier ranking with VisionOrb! The unit names follow the same names that are used for the `~profile` command!
Example: `~vote fire kanonno_gb 10` gives the unit [Greatsword Wielder] Kanonno a score of 10 for Fire Raids
`~vote units` - displays a list of all characters you can vote for!
`~profile clear (element)` - Will clear the support unit that you have set for that element. Not providing an element will clear all your set support units for the profile
