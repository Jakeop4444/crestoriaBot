_What's new in this update:_

- HUGE update and we really mean HUGE update to the `~profile` command. Not only did the profile cards get a new style, there are also new functions and customization options added! Now you can change the background, display your favorite Tales Title or PVP Ranking as Flair, and showcase the Ascension Level of all your support units on your support list!
